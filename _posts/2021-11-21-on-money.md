Earning money can be a great goal, or a terrible goal.  Money lets us buy things like food, shelter, sporting equipment, and medical services. This is why we work for money. This is why I ask myself questions like “How much should I be saving?”. I break down my allocation of money into two categories:
* Money spent on essential things
* Money spent on things that make me happy

We work to add money to our bank account, and then we allocate (spend/save) that money in certain ways. How often do we go into more detail than the diagram above? How should we go into more detail? 
The error that I want to avoid in thinking of money goals is as follows: more money in the bank account allows me to spend more, and that’s good. In trying to understand why this might be a foolish way of thinking about money, we should consider system boundaries: 

In thinking about a given system, we can draw the boundaries wherever we like. The clouds in the diagram above mark the beginnings and ends of the system “flows” and the clouds are elements of the system that are being ignored for the purposes of simplifying the problem. These clouds rarely mark a real boundary, because systems rarely have real boundaries. If we want to come up with a good way of thinking about money, we should figure out where to draw the boundaries for our personal money system. 

One of the problems with keeping the boundaries as they are drawn above is that we don’t know what more money in the bank account drives other than spending and saving. If our categorization of money allocation described earlier is sensible (things that you need and things that make you happy), then we should add this detail to our system model.

How to read this diagram:
* Boxes represent stocks: a store of an amount of something.
* Straight lines between boxes represent flows: Things that change the amount of stock through some action(s).
* Curved arrows represent feedback loops. A feedback loop is formed when changes in a stock affect the flows into or out of that same stock. There are two specific kinds of feedback loops we use here:
  * B: Balancing feedback loop. A balancing feedback loop is a mechanism that resists further changes in one direction. They are goal-seeking or stability seeking.
  * R: Reinforcing feedback loop. A reinforcing feedback loop occurs when an initial change is reinvested to further that change in the future. It generates more input to a stock the more that is already there, and less input the less that is already there. 

In the above stock and flow diagram, work is done to add money to a bank account, of which some amount is saved and/or invested, and the remaining amount is used for spending on necessities and fun things that make us happy. The amount of money in our bank account balances out the amount that we can save. The amount that we have saved balances the amount (or type) of work that we have to do, and also reinforces the amount that we are able to save and invest, as our invested savings may compound over time. The amount of excess money we have from savings can be used to spend, and this amount balances out the amount (or type) of work that we have to do. Finally, the amount that we spend on fun things and necessities balance out the amounts that we have for each activity. 

A few things are clearly left out of this representation: 
* The amount that we save will eventually end up in either fun spending or necessary spending in retirement and/or when we die. In that way, our savings $ is a balancing feedback loop on required work. 
* Not all money in a given person's bank account is made through work. You can inherit money, set up a business that pays you money without having to work on it, you can steal money… 

I’ve drawn the system as it is because it captures most of what matters to me when I think about money. 

In the system depicted above, you can see that income is allocated across three categories: savings, necessary spending, and happy spending. We should sort out how much money should go into each category. 

Daniel Kahneman published a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16489">study</a> in 2010 that claimed that income above $75,000 per year does not produce an increase in emotional well-being. Emotional well-being refers to the emotional quality of an individual's everyday experience—the frequency and intensity of experiences of joy, stress, sadness, anger, and affection that make one's life pleasant or unpleasant. I’ve found myself drawing on this study in conversations with friends, particularly when talking to former classmates of mine who chose to pursue high paying jobs because they are high paying. While I still believe that this is probably a stupid reason to take a job, I now realize that using this study as a basis for my own arguments is also stupid. What I’m proposing instead is that everybody finds this target income number for themselves. 

The exercise is as follows. First, think through the income that you need. What is required to feed yourself, clothe yourself, house yourself, and live with a baseline level of comfort. Yes, you could probably survive without conventional shelter, or by drinking meal supplements for three meals a day, but in this exercise think through the basic level of each category that you see as reasonable to continue living your life. The output might look something like this:
* Housing: $X/year
* Food: $X/year
* Clothing: $X/year
* Healthcare: $X/year
* Essential household items: $X/year
* Etc.

These numbers are going to vary based on where you live, how many dependents you have, and what you consider to be “essential”. I encourage you to be pretty ruthless about what you consider essential… While you might be a die hard Toronto Maple Leafs fan, those season tickets are probably not essential. A cell phone plan, on the other hand, you might consider essential these days.

Next comes the part of the exercise where we need to think through the spending that makes us happy. In order to complete this part of the exercise, I recommend looking through your bank statement from the past few years, and taking note ofhow each of the line items make you feel. Which expenses put a smile on your face? Which ones want to make you cry? You might come up with something like: 
* Groceries: $X/year
* Eating out: $X/year
* Concerts: $X/year
* Hockey equipment: $X/year
* Etc.

I think it’s important to be granular. Purchasing any “sporting equipment” might not make you that happy, whereas purchasing hockey equipment might make you really happy. Also note that some of the spending you make here will overlap with necessary spending (Ex: Groceries, if spending more to eat higher quality food makes you happier). Part of this exercise involves figuring out where to overspend on essentials. Sure, maybe you could live in an apartment for $500/month, but spending $1500/month might make you really happy, and a $2000/month apartment might make you no more happy than that place that costs $1500/month.

Once you’ve gone through your spending and identified the spending that makes you happy, start to put together an annual budget. Just try to be as reasonable as you can be with each category. For example: I recently spent some money on an expensive mountain bike. This bike makes me really happy, and I am getting more joy out of the sport than when I rode a less expensive mountain bike. Let’s say the bike cost me $1000, and I might conclude that I want to spend $1000 every four years on a new mountain bike. So, I will need to add $250 per year to my happy spending budget. 

In carrying out this exercise, you should also think through spending on some things that you’ve never spent on before. Maybe you don’t have a car in your necessary spending budget because you can take the subway to work and choose to rent when you get out of the city, but owning a car would make you really happy because you like to get out of the city most weekends. Be careful not to get carried away here - if you’ve never bought it I would bet cautiously on it making you much happier. 

You should now have a number for happy spending and necessary spending for the present day. I recommend adding a small percentage to this number as a buffer,somewhere from 10%-20%. 

Determining savings is really tricky. If you choose your work well you might not mind working forever. Or maybe you enjoy working but could also picture yourself dropping everything to travel the world or go to graduate school when you’re in your 40s. The point is, thinking through savings is a very personal process. In essence, savings are just deferred spending for things that make you happy and things that you need. 

For this part of the exercise, we’ll borrow from the “<a href="https://n26.com/en-eu/blog/50-30-20-rule">50/30/20</a>” rule. This rule says that no more than 50% of your income should be spent on necessities, no more than 30% on wants, and at least 20% on savings. I recommend you target somewhere from 20%-40% of your income for savings, depending on how early you want to retire and/or what kind of lifestyle you want in retirement. 

So, depending on your target retirement age and desired lifestyle, pick a number from 20%-40%. From there, calculate the following:

*(Happy Spending + Necessary Spending) / (1-Saving %)*

This will give you your number. For example: If I want to spend $40,000/year on happy things, $36,000 on necessities, and save 40% of my income, I will need $126,000 in after tax income. 

*($40,000+$36,000)/(1-0.4)=$126,000*

Okay, so what do we do with this number? If you’ve taken the time to find this number, you’re going to find yourself in one of two places. 

The first outcome is that you’re falling short of the number. If this is the case, you might consider optimizing to increase your income. It doesn’t have to be your primary goal, but if the system we’ve come up with is a representative one, and we’ve thought thoroughly about what we need to survive and be happy, it’s probably important to get our income up to a level close to that number. The levers that we can pull on to improve our happiness are personal; this essay focuses on the universal lever of money. If optimizing to increase your income in this case is going to get in the way of some other areas in your life that contribute to your happiness, maybe think twice. But, if you’re falling short of “the number” and you have the bandwidth to work on it, you may consider working harder for a promotion, a career change to a new line of higher-paying work, or finding another stream of income. This essay isn’t about work or how to make more money, so we’ll leave that there. 

The second outcome is that you’re at or above the number. Great! If this is the case, it’s a clear green light to optimize for other things in life that make you happy. Earlier in the essay, I mentioned that I don’t like the idea that “more money in the bank account allows me to spend more, and that’s good.” This isn’t necessarily a bad idea. If you fall into the first category, then this statement might hold true. On the other hand, if money were to just magically show up in your bank account, or if you’re earning more income in a way that really satisfies you, then more money can be great. However, making money is usually an effortful, time-consuming process. Notice in our systems diagram above that in no place does an increase in saving or spending money add more time to your life. It can move time spent on work to time spent on other things; however, if you have taken care in this exercise to figure out how much income is going to make you happy, I would be very careful about not spending your time just to get more of it. 

This exercise is designed to provide you with a reference point to help you understand what to be optimizing for. If you’re below your number, you might put more emphasis on increasing your yearly income. If you’re above it, you have the flexibility to focus on other things. If you’re happily working away on things that earn you way more money than you need, then that’s nice! But I don’t think it should be pushed for if you have what you know is enough for you.
